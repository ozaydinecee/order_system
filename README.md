#  Functions, loops and data structures


## Exercise Instructions

1. Open the script ordering_system.py present inside the project folder.

2. Run the script and, when requested, enter in the three products of your choice based on the menu - 1 = espresso, 2 = coffee etc.

3. To run the script, open terminal and execute the following command. 

    ```
    python3 ordering_system.py
    ```

4. Extend the script to have a new function called `calculate_subtotal`.  
 It should accept one argument which is the order list and return the sum   
 of the prices of the items in the order list.

5. Implement `calculate_tax()` which calculates the tax of the subtotal.   
The tax percentage is 15% of overall bill.

6. Implement `summarize_order()` which returns a list of the names of the items   
that the customer ordered and the total amount (including tax) that they have to pay.  
 The orders should show the name and price.
